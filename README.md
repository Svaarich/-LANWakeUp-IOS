Finally, a user-friendly Wake on LAN app!
Anywakey is an application that allows you to start up a computer remotely via Wake on LAN technology by sending "magic packet".

Just enter your device IP(or Domain name) and MAC address into the app, then press the Boot(Power) button and your computer will start up if all was configured properly (Port must be open in your router to use outside of your home network (LAN)).

Application features:
- device import / export 
- widgets
- custom port
- use domain name or IP address
- pin most used devices to favourites
- check online status of the device
- see ping of the IP address or the domain
- Apple Watch companion application and more are coming soon...

WoL is an Ethernet networking standard that allows a properly configured network computer to be turned on or awakened by a network message. 
Before using the application, ensure the target computer is fully configured to work with the Wake on LAN protocol.
